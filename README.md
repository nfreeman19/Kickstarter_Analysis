### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To show by percentage the outcomes for goals specifically by amount of money were either successful, failed or canceled.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the biggest challenges was the amount of information given. I beileve with a data set that large it can have "random" outliers that make the data look all over the place. Luckily with my graphs and charts I don't believe that really was the case. I thought I did something wrong in my Outcomes_vs_Goals graph when the Canceled line was straight and at zero but by double checking my work it was correct. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The outcomes were all over the place but never overlapping. The months of May and June had a highly successful outcome.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
